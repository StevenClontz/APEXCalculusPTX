<p>The intuition behind the assumption here is that a disease can only spread if there are individuals who are susceptible to the infection. As fewer and fewer people are able to be infected, the disease spread should slow down. Since <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is proportion of the population that is sick, <span class="process-math">\(1-y\)</span> is the proportion who are not sick, and the differential equation is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = k(1-y)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Though the context is quite different, the differential equation is identical to the differential equation for Newton's Law of Cooling, with <span class="process-math">\(A=1\text{.}\)</span> The solution is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
y = 1 - Ce^{-kt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The conditions <span class="process-math">\(y(0)=0.05\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(1) = 0.1\)</span> yield <span class="process-math">\(C = 0.95\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k = -\ln\left(\frac{18}{19}\right) \approx 0.0541\text{,}\)</span> so the final function is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
y = 1-.95e^{\ln\left(\frac{18}{19}\right)t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Notice that this function approaches <span class="process-math">\(y=1\)</span> in the limit as <span class="process-math">\(t \to \infty\text{,}\)</span> and does not suffer from the non-physical behavior described in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_disease_exponential.html" title="Example 8.4.4: Disease Spread 1">ExampleÂ 8.4.4</a>.</p>
