<p>To find <span class="process-math">\(\vat\text{,}\)</span> we take the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(\vrt\)</span> twice.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\vvt = \vrp(t) \amp = \la -8\pi \sin(4\pi t), 8\pi \cos(4\pi t)\ra\\
\vat =\vrp'(t) \amp = \la -32\pi^2 \cos(4\pi t), -32\pi^2 \sin(4\pi t) \ra\\

<p class="continuation">Note how <span class="process-math">\(\vat\)</span> is parallel to <span class="process-math">\(\vrt\text{,}\)</span> but has a different magnitude and points in the opposite direction. Why is this?</p>
<p>Recall the classic physics equation, “Force <span class="process-math">\(=\)</span> mass <span class="times-sign">×</span> acceleration.” A force acting on a mass induces acceleration (i.e., the mass moves); acceleration acting on a mass induces a force (gravity gives our mass a <em class="emphasis">weight</em>). Thus force and acceleration are closely related. A moving ball “wants” to travel in a straight line. Why does the ball in our example move in a circle? It is attached to the boy's hand by a string. The string applies a force to the ball, affecting its motion: the string <em class="emphasis">accelerates</em> the ball. This is not acceleration in the sense of “it travels faster;” rather, this acceleration is changing the velocity of the ball. In what direction is this force/acceleration being applied? In the direction of the string, towards the boy's hand.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the acceleration is related to the speed at which the ball is traveling. A ball whirling quickly is rapidly changing direction/velocity. When velocity is changing rapidly, the acceleration must be “large.”</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_vvf_motion.html#li-2371" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
