<p>The direction of the normal line has many uses, one of which is the definition of the <em class="emphasis">tangent plane</em> which we define shortly. Another use is in measuring distances from the surface to a point. Given a point <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> in space, it is a general geometric concept to define the distance from <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> to the surface as being the length of the shortest line segment <span class="process-math">\(\overline{PQ}\)</span> over all points <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> on the surface. This, in turn, implies that <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{PQ}\)</span> will be orthogonal to the surface at <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> Therefore we can measure the distance from <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> to the surface <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by finding a point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> on the surface such that <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{PQ}\)</span> is parallel to the normal line to <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span></p>
