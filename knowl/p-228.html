<p>The previous example was a little long in that we sampled a few specific cases of <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> before handling the general case. Normally this is not done. The previous example is also a bit unsatisfying in that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{4}=2\text{;}\)</span> why work so hard to prove something so obvious? Many <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-<span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> proofs are long and difficult to do. In this section, we will focus on examples where the answer is, frankly, obvious, because the non-obvious examples are even harder. In the next section we will learn some theorems that allow us to evaluate limits <em class="emphasis">analytically</em>, that is, without using the <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-<span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> definition.</p>
