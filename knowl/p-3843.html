<p>There are two immediate solutions that we could consider, each of which we will reject through “common sense.” First, we could minimize the distance by directly connecting the two locations with a straight line. However, this requires that all the wire be laid underwater, the most costly option. Second, we could minimize the underwater length by running a wire all <span class="quantity">5000 ft</span> along the beach, directly across from the offshore facility. This has the undesired effect of having the longest distance of all, probably ensuring a non-minimal cost.</p>
