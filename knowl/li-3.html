<p>In mathematics, <em class="emphasis">proving</em> something is always true is extremely important, and entails much more than testing to see if it works twice. However, students often are confused by the details of a proof, or become concerned that they should have been able to construct this proof on their own. To alleviate this potential problem, we do not include the proofs to most theorems in the text. The interested reader is highly encouraged to find proofs online or from their instructor. In most cases, one is very capable of understanding what a theorem <em class="emphasis">means</em> and <em class="emphasis">how to apply it</em> without knowing fully <em class="emphasis">why</em> it is true.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="apex-preface.html#li-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
