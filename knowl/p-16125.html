<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_divthm_space2.html" title="Example 15.7.3: Using the Divergence Theorem in space">ExampleÂ 15.7.3</a> we see that the total outward flux of a vector field across a closed surface can be found two different ways because of the Divergence Theorem. One computation took far less work to obtain. In that particular case, since <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> was comprised of three separate surfaces, it was far simpler to compute one triple integral than three surface integrals (each of which required partial derivatives and a cross product). In practice, if outward flux needs to be measured, one would choose only one method. We will use both methods in this section simply to reinforce the truth of the Divergence Theorem.</p>
