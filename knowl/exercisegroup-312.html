<p>A cylindrical storage tank is to be 2ft tall with a radius of 1ft. Is the volume of the tank more sensitive to changes in the radius or the height?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">14<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p><em class="emphasis">Projectile Motion:</em> The <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-value of an object moving under the principles of projectile motion is <span class="process-math">\(x(\theta,v_0,t)= (v_0\cos(\theta) )t\text{.}\)</span> A particular projectile is fired with an initial velocity of <span class="process-math">\(v_0=250\)</span>ft/s and an angle of elevation of <span class="process-math">\(\theta = 60^\circ\text{.}\)</span> It travels a distance of <span class="process-math">\(375\)</span>ft in 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Is the projectile more sensitive to errors in initial speed or angle of elevation?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">15<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>The length <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> of a long wall is to be approximated. The angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{,}\)</span> as shown in the diagram (not to scale), is measured to be <span class="process-math">\(85^\circ\text{,}\)</span> and the distance <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is measured to be 30'. Assume that the triangle formed is a right triangle.</p>
<p>Is the measurement of the length of <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> more sensitive to errors in the measurement of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> or in <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{?}\)</span></p>

<p>It is “common sense” that it is far better to measure a long distance with a long measuring tape rather than a short one. A measured distance <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> can be viewed as the product of the length <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> of a measuring tape times the number <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> of times it was used. For instance, using a 3' tape 10 times gives a length of 30'. To measure the same distance with a 12' tape, we would use the tape 2.5 times. (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(30=12\times 2.5\text{.}\)</span>) Thus <span class="process-math">\(D = n\ell\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Suppose each time a measurement is taken with the tape, the recorded distance is within 1/16'' of the actual distance. (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(d\ell = 1/16'' \approx 0.005\)</span>ft). Using differentials, show why common sense proves correct in that it is better to use a long tape to measure long distances.</p></article>
