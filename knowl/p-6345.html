<p>Other indeterminate forms exist; they are: <span class="process-math">\(\infty/\infty\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(0\cdot\infty\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\infty-\infty\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(0^0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(1^\infty\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\infty^0\text{.}\)</span> Just as “0/0” does not mean “divide 0 by 0,” the expression “<span class="process-math">\(\infty/\infty\)</span>” does not mean “divide infinity by infinity.” Instead, it means “a quantity is growing without bound and is being divided by another quantity that is growing without bound.” We cannot determine from such a statement what value, if any, results in the limit. Likewise, “<span class="process-math">\(0\cdot \infty\)</span>” does not mean “multiply zero by infinity.” Instead, it means “one quantity is shrinking to zero, and is being multiplied by a quantity that is growing without bound.” We cannot determine from such a description what the result of such a limit will be.</p>
