<li><p>The distance formula cannot be used because since <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_2\)</span> are parallel, <span class="process-math">\(\vec c\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\vec 0\)</span> and we cannot divide by <span class="process-math">\(\vnorm{0}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Since <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_2\)</span> are parallel, <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}\)</span> lies in the plane formed by the two lines. Thus <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}\times\vec d_2\)</span> is orthogonal to this plane, and <span class="process-math">\(\vec c=(\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}\times\vec d_2)\times \vec d_2\)</span> is parallel to the plane, but still orthogonal to both <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_2\text{.}\)</span> We desire the length of the projection of <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}\)</span> onto <span class="process-math">\(\vec c\text{,}\)</span> which is what the formula provides.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the lines are parallel, one can measure the distance between the lines at any location on either line (just as to find the distance between straight railroad tracks, one can use a measuring tape anywhere along the track, not just at one specific place.) Let <span class="process-math">\(P=P_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q=P_2\)</span> as given by the equations of the lines, and apply the formula for distance between a point and a line.</p></li>
