<li><p>Read the problem carefully and identify the quantities that are changing with time. (There may be many quantities that change with time, try to identify which variables are important to your goal and only focus on these quantities.)</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a diagram (if applicable) and assign mathematical variables to each quantity that is changing with time. (If you are given a particular value of a quantity that is also changing with time, do not include these values on your diagram. We will call these “instantaneous values” of the variable.)</p></li>
<li><p>Relate the important variables using a mathematical model. (Typical models are known formulas for area, perimeter, the Pythagorean Theorem or Trigonometric Ratios.) It may be necessary to use more than one technique (such as similar triangles) to reduce your model down to one that only involves the variables of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Implicitly differentiate both sides of the equation found in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/li_rrmodel.html" title="Item 3">Step 3</a> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Substitute in the known values of rates and known instantaneous values of the variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve for the unknown rate.</p></li>
