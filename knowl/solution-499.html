<p>We should first note that there is never exactly one function that describes a finite set of numbers as a sequence. There are many sequences that start with 2, then 5, as our first example does. We are looking for a simple formula that describes the terms given, knowing there is possibly more than one answer.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Note how each term is 3 more than the previous one. This implies a linear function would be appropriate: <span class="process-math">\(a(n) = a_n = 3n + b\)</span> for some appropriate value of <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> If we were to think in terms of ordered pairs, they would be of the form <span class="process-math">\((n,a(n))\text{.}\)</span> So one such ordered pair would be <span class="process-math">\((1,2)\text{.}\)</span> As we want <span class="process-math">\(a_1=2\text{,}\)</span> we set <span class="process-math">\(b=-1\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(a_n = 3n-1\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>First notice how the sign changes from term to term. This is most commonly accomplished by multiplying the terms by either <span class="process-math">\((-1)^n\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\((-1)^{n+1}\text{.}\)</span> Using <span class="process-math">\((-1)^n\)</span> multiplies the odd indexed terms by <span class="process-math">\((-1)\text{.}\)</span> Thus the first term would be negative and the second term would be positive. Multiplying by <span class="process-math">\((-1)^{n+1}\)</span> multiplies the even indexed terms by <span class="process-math">\((-1)\text{.}\)</span> Thus the second term would be negative and the first term would be positive. As this sequence has negative even indexed terms, we will multiply by <span class="process-math">\((-1)^{n+1}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>After this, we might feel a bit stuck as to how to proceed. At this point, we are just looking for a pattern of some sort: what do the numbers 2, 5, 10, 17, etc., have in common? There are many correct answers, but the one that we'll use here is that each is one more than a perfect square. That is, <span class="process-math">\(2=1^2+1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(5=2^2+1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(10=3^2+1\text{,}\)</span> etc. Thus our formula is <span class="process-math">\(b_n= (-1)^{n+1}(n^2+1)\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>One who is familiar with the factorial function will readily recognize these numbers. They are <span class="process-math">\(0!\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(1!\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2!\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(3!\text{,}\)</span> etc. Since our sequences start with <span class="process-math">\(n=1\text{,}\)</span> we cannot write <span class="process-math">\(c_n = n!\text{,}\)</span> for this misses the <span class="process-math">\(0!\)</span> term. Instead, we shift by 1, and write <span class="process-math">\(c_n = (n-1)!\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>This one may appear difficult, especially as the first two terms are the same, but a little “sleuthing” will help. Notice how the terms in the numerator are always multiples of 5, and the terms in the denominator are always powers of 2. Does something as simple as <span class="process-math">\(d_n = \frac{5n}{2^n}\)</span> work?</p>
<p>When <span class="process-math">\(n=1\text{,}\)</span> we see that we indeed get <span class="process-math">\(5/2\)</span> as desired. When <span class="process-math">\(n=2\text{,}\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\(10/4 = 5/2\text{.}\)</span> Further checking shows that this formula indeed matches the other terms of the sequence.</p>
