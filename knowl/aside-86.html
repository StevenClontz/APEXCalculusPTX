<aside class="aside aside-like"><p>There is a subtlety in this calculation that can be quite confusing. It appears to be chain rule, but shouldn't the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y,z)\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be simply <span class="process-math">\(f_x(x,y,z)\text{?}\)</span> The catch here is that we are considering the variables <span class="process-math">\(x,y,z\)</span> (viewed as coordinates in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>) as functions of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> viewed as coordinates in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>In other words, the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(g(x,y)\)</span> are not the same as the ones in <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y,z)\text{!}\)</span> If this is still confusing, try setting <span class="process-math">\(x=s\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y=t\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z=g(s,t)\text{,}\)</span> and then applying the chain rule as usual, for derivatives of <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y,z)\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> At the end, we can relabel <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span></p></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_multi_chain.html#aside-86" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
