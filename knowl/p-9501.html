<p>There are simpler, more direct ways of solving the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(y' = 2y\text{,}\)</span> as discussed in <a href="chapter_differential_equations.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Differential Equations">ChapterÂ 8</a>. We applied power series techniques to this equation to demonstrate its utility, and went on to show how <em class="emphasis">sometimes</em> we are able to recover the solution in terms of elementary functions using the theory of Taylor series. Most differential equations faced in real scientific and engineering situations are much more complicated than this one, but power series can offer a valuable tool in finding, or at least approximating, the solution.</p>
